# E-commerce Analysis

This project applies the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach to segment customers of a UK-based online retailer, using transaction data from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011. By engineering relevant features and leveraging clustering algorithms, we convert raw data into actionable customer profiles.

The goal is to improve marketing efficiency and boost sales by identifying key customer segments and understanding their purchasing behavior. This segmentation reveals distinct profiles, providing valuable insights for targeted strategies and better customer retention.
